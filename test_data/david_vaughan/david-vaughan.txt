Patient Notes:
2017-07-20: Discharge Summary DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis. 2. History
of T9 vertebral fracture. 3. Diskitis. 4. Thrombocytopenia. 5. Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of
approximately 30%. 6. Diabetes, type 2. 7. Protein malnourishment. 8. History of anemia. HISTORY AND HOSPITAL
COURSE: The patient is a 77-year-old white male who presented to Hospital of Bossier on April 14, 2008 with fever
and severe lower back pain and severe weakness. The patient was found to have lumbar Diskitis that requires extensive
antibiotic therapy, which required hospitalization due to his dialysis. He also needed increase the frequency of his
dialysis due to worsening renal function. Dialysis time was extended and frequency was increased to three times per
week. He needed to begin active rehabilitation. The patient tolerated his medication well and he was going through
rehab fairly well without any significant troubles. He did have some bouts of issues with constipation on and off
throughout his hospitalization, but this seemed to come under control with more aggressive management. The patient
had remained afebrile. He did also have a bout with some episodic confusion problems, which appeared to be more of a
sundowner-type of a problem, but this too cleared with his stay here at Promise. On the day of discharge, on May 9,
2008, the patient was in good spirits, was very clear and lucid. He denied any complaints of pain. He did have some
trouble with sleep at night at times, but I think this was mainly tied into the fact that he sleeps a lot during the day. The
patient has increased his appetite some and has been eating some. His vital signs remain stable. His blood pressure on
discharge was 126/63, heart rate is 80, respiratory rate of 20 and temperature was 98.3. PPD was negative. An SMS

form was filled out in plan for his discharge and he was sent with medications that he had been receiving while here at
Promise. The patient and his family understood our plan and agreed with it. He thanked us for the care that he received
at Promise and thought that they did a fantastic job taking care of him. He did not have any acute questions as to where
he was going and what the next step of his care would be, but we did discuss this at length prior to date of discharge.
His understanding of the complexity of his disease treatments appears to be low. His niece will stay with him for the
next 2 weeks to ensure his compliance with meds and diet.
