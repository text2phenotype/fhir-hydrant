PERSONAL HISTORY: She is a nonsmoker. Does not consume alcohol. No history of recreational drug use. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY: Basically GI pathology with diverticulitis, colitis, hypothyroidism, arthritis, questionable
hypertension, no prior history of coronary artery disease, and heart murmur. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
CONSTITUTIONAL: Weakness, fatigue, and tiredness. HEENT: History of cataract, blurred vision, and hearing
impairment. CARDIOVASCULAR: Shortness of breath and heart murmur. No coronary artery disease.
RESPIRATORY: Shortness of breath. No pneumonia or valley fever. GASTROINTESTINAL: No nausea, vomiting,
hematemesis, or melena. UROLOGICAL: No frequency or urgency. MUSCULOSKELETAL: Arthritis and severe
muscle weakness. SKIN: Nonsignificant. NEUROLOGICAL: No TIA or CVA. No seizure disorder.
ENDOCRINE/HEMATOLOGICAL: As above. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION VITAL SIGNS: Pulse of 84, blood
pressure of 168/74, afebrile, and respiratory rate 16 per minute. HEENT/NECK: Head is atraumatic and normocephalic.
Neck veins flat. No significant carotid bruits appreciated. LUNGS: Air entry bilaterally fair. No obvious rales or
wheezes. HEART: PMI displaced. S1, S2 with systolic murmur at the precordium, grade 2/6. ABDOMEN: Soft and
nontender. EXTREMITIES: Chronic skin changes. Feeble pulses distally. No clubbing or cyanosis. DIAGNOSTIC
DATA: EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. No acute ST-T changes. Echocardiogram was reviewed showing severe mitral
regurgitation. LABORATORY DATA: H&H 13 and 39. BUN and creatinine within normal limits. Potassium within
normal limits. BNP 9290. IMPRESSION: 1. The patient admitted for gastrointestinal pathology, under working
treatment. 2. History of prior heart murmur with Echocardiogram findings as above. Basically revealed normal left
ventricular function with left atrial enlargement, large pleural effusion, and severe mitral regurgitation and tricuspid
regurgitation. Discharge Recommendations: 1. Finish antibiotics, High fiber diet for diverticulitis. PCP follow up in 30
days 2. From cardiac standpoint, conservative treatment. Possibility of a transesophageal echocardiogram to assess
valvular insufficiency adequately well discussed extensively. After extensive discussion, given her age 86, limited
activity level, and no intention of undergoing any treatment in this regard from a surgical standpoint, the patient does
not wish to proceed with a transesophageal echocardiogram. 3. Based on the above findings, we will treat her cardiac
disease medically with ACE inhibitors and diuretics and see how she fares. She has a normal LV function.
